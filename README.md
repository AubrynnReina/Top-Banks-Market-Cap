# Top-Banks-Market-Cap

This is a personal project for me to practice using Python, bs4, SQL, and pandas.

In this project, I have:
- Implemented a script where I get the top banks in market cap on a webisite, apply some transformation to the data, save it to a database and a .csv file.
- Created a log file with timestamp to keep track of each process' duration.
